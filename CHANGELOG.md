# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.9.2] - 2025-05-28

### Changed

- `objdiff_report`:
  - Simplify emitted entries by avoiding using quotes as much as possible when
    using the `--emit-categories` flag.
  - Avoid printing the summary table when using the `--emit-categories`.
  - Allow customizing the output of the summary table a little bit via the
    Python API.

## [2.9.1] - 2025-05-27

### Added

- Add `--emit-categories` flag to `objdiff_report`.
  - Prints to stdout automatically-generated categories from the mapfile.
    Categories will use the `decomp.yaml` format.
  - Intended to facilitate to integrate this progress reporting method.
  - The generated categories are expected to be modified by the user and not
    used as is.
- Print a summary from the generated progress report in `objdiff_report`.
  - Printed to stdout by default.
  - This will be printed as a summary step if the script detects it is being run
    in a Github Action.

### Changed

- Metroweks ld: Parse alignment column.

### Fixed

- GNU maps:
  - Fix parsing the segment's metadata (name, address, etc) when the
    segment does not have a rom address.
  - Properly drop empty segments from the parsed output.
- Fix parsing if the mapfile contains Carriage Returns characters (`\r`).

## [2.9.0] - 2025-05-25

### Added

- Support emitting progress reports using
  [`objdiff`](https://github.com/encounter/objdiff)'s format.
  - Relies mainly on `.NON_MATCHING`-suffixed marker symbols being present on
    the mapfile for each non-matched symbol.
  - Rust:
    - Disabled by default, it is gated by the `objdiff_report` feature.
    - Use `MapFile::get_objdiff_report()` to generate the report.
    - It is recommended to mix with the `serde` feature to make serialization of
      the report easier.
  - Python:
    - Use `MapFile::writeObjdiffReportToFile()` to write an objdiff report as a
      `json` file.
- Add `objdiff_report` as a new CLI utility to the Python library.
  - Generate a simple `objdiff` progress report from your terminal!
  - This utility supports the `decomp.yaml` format. This format is the preferred
    way of invoking the tool, given the long list of arguments needed for the
    tool to properly work.
- Add support for Metrowerks ld mapfiles.
  - Existing catch-all functions will try to guess if the given mapfile
    correspond to this kind of map by default.
  - New functions:
    - `MapFile::new_from_mw_map_str()` (Rust) and `MapFile::newFromMwMapStr()`
      (Python): Parses specifically a Metrowerks ld mapfile without guessing.

### Changed

- Update `decomp_settings` to version 0.0.9.
- Bump MSRV from `1.65.0` to `1.74.0`.

## [2.8.1] - 2025-05-22

### Fixed

- Fix broken CLI utilities when a decomp.yaml file is not detected.

## [2.8.0] - 2025-05-20

### Added

- `File::symbol_match_state_iter()` function. Returns an iterator over
  `SymbolDecompState`, which allows to know if a symbol is considered decompiled
  or not decompiled yet.
- `Section::is_fill`. `true` if the section is a `*fill*` entry.
- `MapFile::get_every_section_except_section_type`. Provides the same
  functionallity as the old `MapFile::get_every_file_except_section_type`
  function.
- `Segment::get_every_section_except_section_type`. Provides the same
  functionallity as the old `Segment::get_every_file_except_section_type`
  function.
- `MapFile::new_from_map_file`, `MapFile::new_from_map_str`,
  `MapFile::new_from_gnu_map_str` and `MapFile::new_from_lld_map_str`.
- `Symbol::nonmatching_sym_exists`. This will be set to `true` if a symbol with
  the same name but with a `.NON_MATCHING` suffix is found on the same section.
  - The other suffixed symbol (`.NON_MATCHING`) is still retained in the section.
  - The suffixed symbol will have this member set to `false`.
- Add support for the `decomp.yaml` specification from the
  [`decomp_settings`](https://github.com/ethteck/decomp_settings) project on all
  the provided CLI utilities.
  - If a `decomp.yaml` file is detected, then every CLI argument that can be
    inferred from that file will be be considered optional instead.
  - Most CLI utilites will also add a new optional "version" argument to allow
    picking the version to process from the `decomp.yaml` file. It defaults to
    the first listed version.

### Changed

- Change `Symbol.size` to `u64` from `Option<u64>`.
- Rename `File` to `Section`.
  - `File` is still available as an alias to `Section`, but it is recommended to
    use the new name instead.
- Detect `.NON_MATCHING` symbols and fix the size of both the real symbol and
  the `.NON_MATCHING` one during parsing.

### Deprecated

- `File`. Use `Section` instead.
- `MapFile::get_every_file_except_section_type`. Use
  `MapFile::get_every_section_except_section_type` instead.
- `Segment::get_every_file_except_section_type`. Use
  `Segment::get_every_section_except_section_type` instead.
- `MapFile::new`. Use either `MapFile::new_from_map_file` or
  `MapFile::new_from_map_str` instead.
- `MapFile::read_map_file`. Use either `MapFile::new_from_map_file` instead.
- `MapFile::parse_map_contents`. Use either `MapFile::new_from_map_str` instead.
- `MapFile::parse_map_contents_gnu`. Use either `MapFile::new_from_gnu_map_str`
  instead.
- `MapFile::parse_map_contents_lld`. Use either `MapFile::new_from_lld_map_str`
  instead.
- Deprecate `MapFile::fixup_non_matching_symbols` and family. This functionality
  is perform automatically during parsing now.
  - Calling this function is effectively a no-op now.

### Fixed

- Avoid pointless internal copy during the parsing of GNU mapfiles.

## [2.7.5] - 2025-05-08

### Fixed

- Fix Rust release.

## [2.7.4] - 2025-03-19

### Fixed

- Fix size calculation for the last symbol of a section not properly accounting
  if the first symbol of said section is a `static` symbol (meaning it is
  missing from the mapfile).
  - This fix only applies to GNU mapfiles.

## [2.7.3] - 2025-02-09

### Fixed

- Fix symbol's VROM calculation not properly accounting for the first symbol of
  the section being a `static` symbol (missing from the mapfile).
  - This fix only applies to GNU mapfiles.

## [2.7.2] - 2024-12-15

### Added

- Prebuilt binaries for Python 3.13.

### Changed

- Python 3.9 or later is now required.
  - Bump from Python 3.8 to 3.9.
  - Older versions can't be checked on CI anymore, so I prefer to not claim to
    support something that may have broken without anybody noticing.
  - Nothing really changed. Just the CI tools I was using are refusing to use
    any Python version older than this. Sorry if you were affected by this.
- Use newer pyo3 version.
  - From 0.20 to 0.23.
  - Updated to avoid warnings with newer Rust versions.
  - Fix issues introduced by updating pyo3.

## [2.7.1] - 2024-09-25

### Added

- Add `--json` flag to `progress` frontend.
  - Prints the output as json instead of using a human readable format.

### Changed

- Improve lifetime usage and avoid unnecessary clones on Rust side.

## [2.7.0] - 2024-09-24

### Added

- `MapFile.findSymbolByVram` and `MapFile.findSymbolByVrom` methods.
  - Allow to search a symbol given a given address. The address will be treated
    as either a vram address or a vrom address respectively.
- Add `--vram`, `--vrom` and `--name` arguments to `sym_info` frontend.
  - Allow to tell to `sym_info` exactly how to treat the argument instead of
    trying to guess how to use it.
- `sym_info` can now detect that an address may belong to a file even when the
  symbol itself may not exist on the mapfile.
  - This can happen for local symbols, for example for rodata literals.

### Deprecated

- `MapFile.findSymbolByVramOrVrom`.
  - Use `MapFile.findSymbolByVram` and `MapFile.findSymbolByVrom` instead.

### Fixed

- Fix typo that prevented using `jsonify`.

## [2.6.0] - 2024-08-26

### Added

  - `printingStyle`: The style to use to print the symbols, either `"csv"` or
    `"listing"`.
  - TODO: port to Rust.
- New `MapFile.fixupNonMatchingSymbols` method.
  - Allows to fixup size calculation of symbols messed up by symbols with the
    same name suffixed with `.NON_MATCHING`.
- Add support for `.NON_MATCHING` suffix on symbols on progress calculation.
  - If a symbol exists and has a `.NON_MATCHING`-suffixed counterpart then
    consider it not mateched yet.

### Changed

  - Symbol shifting (due to different sizes or extra/missing symbols) should
    not affect comparing non shifted files.
- `Cargo.lock` file is now committed to the repo.
- Change Rust functions to properly take references instead of consuming the
  argument.

### Fixed

- Fix `MapFile::find_lowest_differing_symbol` not returning a previous symbol

- New functions:
  - `MapFile.parseMapContents`/`MapFile::parse_map_contents`
    - Parses the map contents passed as the argument, without requiring the map
      being on an actual file.
    - The map format will be guessed on the contents. Currently both the GNU ld
      and clang ld.lld map formats are recognized.
  - `MapFile.parseMapContentsGNU`/`MapFile::parse_map_contents_gnu`
    - Parses the map contents passed as the argument, without requiring the map
      being on an actual file.
    - This function only parses the GNU ld map format.
  - `MapFile.parseMapContentsLLD`/`MapFile::parse_map_contents_lld`
    - Parses the map contents passed as the argument, without requiring the map
      being on an actual file.
    - This function only parses the clang ld.lld map format.
- New members:
  - `Symbol.align`/`Symbol::align`, `File.align`/`File::align` and
    `Segment.align`/`Segment::align`: The alignment the given type. This member
    will be filled by the parser only if the mapfile provides this information.

### Changed

- `MapFile.readMapFile`/`MapFile::read_map_file` can now guess the map format
  between any of the known formats.
- Some known symbol names will be automatically filtered out during the parsing
  step.
  - Currently only `gcc2_compiled.` is filtered out.

### Fixed

- Fix parser not detecting `*fill*` lines on GNU ld maps if they specified the
  value that was used for filling/padding.
- `.sbss`, `COMMON` and `.scommon` sections are now properly considered noload
  sections.

## [2.2.1] - 2023-10-08

### Fixed

- Fix Rust crate size being too big
  - crates.io was rejecting the package because of the size
  - Cargo was packaging all the map files and test cases, making the package be
    15 MiB. Now it is around 16.3 KiB

## [2.2.0] - 2023-10-08

### Added

- Add new Rust re-implementation (#15)
  - Allows using this library in native Rust projects
  - It does not replace the Python implementation due to restrictions on how
    Rust bindings work.
  - Python bindings for the Rust implementation exists, but they are not used
    or exposed to the user
- Now this library has a Rust crate.
  - Check it at <https://crates.io/crates/mapfile_parser>

### Changed

- Speed-up the actual parsing of a mapfile by using the native Rust implementation
  - Up to 10 times faster parsing has been registered

## [2.1.3] - 2023-08-30

### Fixed

- Fix version number
  - pypi thought previous version was a prerelease instead of a full release

## [2.1.2] - 2023-08-30

  the CLI.

### Changed

- Change logic of `MapFile` so it can parse and organize each file in proper
  segments.
  - This breaks old ways of iterating the `MapFile` class. Now iterating it
    yields a `Segment`, iterating that yields a `File`.
- Rename `segmentType` to `sectionType` and `filterBySegmentType` to
  `filterBySectionType`.

## [1.3.0] - 2023-08-01
