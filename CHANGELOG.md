## [Unreleased]

## [2.7.2] - 2024-12-15

### Added

- Prebuilt binaries for Python 3.13.

### Changed

- Python 3.9 or later is now required.
  - Bump from Python 3.8 to 3.9.
  - Older versions can't be checked on CI anymore, so I prefer to not claim to
    support something that may have broken without anybody noticing.
  - Nothing really changed. Just the CI tools I was using are refusing to use
    any Python version older than this. Sorry if you were affected by this.
- Use newer pyo3 version.
  - From 0.20 to 0.23.
  - Updated to avoid warnings with newer Rust versions.
  - Fix issues introduced by updating pyo3.

## [2.7.1] - 2024-09-25

### Added

- Add `--json` flag to `progress` frontend.
  - Prints the output as json instead of using a human readable format.

### Changed

- Improve lifetime usage and avoid unnecessary clones on Rust side.

## [2.7.0] - 2024-09-24

### Added

- `MapFile.findSymbolByVram` and `MapFile.findSymbolByVrom` methods.
  - Allow to search a symbol given a given address. The address will be treated
    as either a vram address or a vrom address respectively.
- Add `--vram`, `--vrom` and `--name` arguments to `sym_info` frontend.
  - Allow to tell to `sym_info` exactly how to treat the argument instead of
    trying to guess how to use it.
- `sym_info` can now detect that an address may belong to a file even when the
  symbol itself may not exist on the mapfile.
  - This can happen for local symbols, for example for rodata literals.

### Deprecated

- `MapFile.findSymbolByVramOrVrom`.
  - Use `MapFile.findSymbolByVram` and `MapFile.findSymbolByVrom` instead.

### Fixed

- Fix typo that prevented using `jsonify`.

## [2.6.0] - 2024-08-26

### Added

- Add new parameters to `bss_check.printSymbolComparison`.
  - `printGoods`: Allows toggling printing the GOOD symbols.
  - `printingStyle`: The style to use to print the symbols, either `"csv"` or
    `"listing"`.
  - TODO: port to Rust.
- New `MapFile.fixupNonMatchingSymbols` method.
  - Allows to fixup size calculation of symbols messed up by symbols with the
    same name suffixed with `.NON_MATCHING`.
- Add support for `.NON_MATCHING` suffix on symbols on progress calculation.
  - If a symbol exists and has a `.NON_MATCHING`-suffixed counterpart then
    consider it not mateched yet.

### Changed

### Changed

- Tweak symbol comparison logic a bit.
  - Symbol shifting (due to different sizes or extra/missing symbols) should
    not affect comparing non shifted files.
- `Cargo.lock` file is now committed to the repo.
- Change Rust functions to properly take references instead of consuming the
  argument.

### Fixed

- Fix `MapFile::find_lowest_differing_symbol` not returning a previous symbol
  from a previous file if the symbol found is the first symbol from the file.

## [2.4.0] - 2024-03-25

### Added

- Add `endian` argument to `doFirstDiff`.
- Add `--endian` option to `first_diff` script.

  the `filepath` member.

## [2.3.1] - 2023-12-23

### Added

- Add a few utility methods to `ProgressStats`.

### Changed

- `pyo3` is no longer needed to use this crate as Rust-only library.
- Updated Rust dependencies.

## [2.3.0] - 2023-11-05

### Added

- Support for parsing clang lld's map fles.
- New functions:
  - `MapFile.parseMapContents`/`MapFile::parse_map_contents`
    - Parses the map contents passed as the argument, without requiring the map
      being on an actual file.
    - The map format will be guessed on the contents. Currently both the GNU ld
      and clang ld.lld map formats are recognized.
  - `MapFile.parseMapContentsGNU`/`MapFile::parse_map_contents_gnu`
    - Parses the map contents passed as the argument, without requiring the map
      being on an actual file.
    - This function only parses the GNU ld map format.
  - `MapFile.parseMapContentsLLD`/`MapFile::parse_map_contents_lld`
    - Parses the map contents passed as the argument, without requiring the map
      being on an actual file.
    - This function only parses the clang ld.lld map format.
- New members:
  - `Symbol.align`/`Symbol::align`, `File.align`/`File::align` and
    `Segment.align`/`Segment::align`: The alignment the given type. This member
    will be filled by the parser only if the mapfile provides this information.

### Changed

- `MapFile.readMapFile`/`MapFile::read_map_file` can now guess the map format
  between any of the known formats.
- Some known symbol names will be automatically filtered out during the parsing
  step.
  - Currently only `gcc2_compiled.` is filtered out.

### Fixed

- Fix parser not detecting `*fill*` lines on GNU ld maps if they specified the
  value that was used for filling/padding.
- `.sbss`, `COMMON` and `.scommon` sections are now properly considered noload
  sections.

## [2.2.1] - 2023-10-08

### Fixed

- Fix Rust crate size being too big
  - crates.io was rejecting the package because of the size
  - Cargo was packaging all the map files and test cases, making the package be
    15 MiB. Now it is around 16.3 KiB

## [2.2.0] - 2023-10-08

### Added

- Add new Rust re-implementation (#15)
  - Allows using this library in native Rust projects
  - It does not replace the Python implementation due to restrictions on how
    Rust bindings work.
  - Python bindings for the Rust implementation exists, but they are not used
    or exposed to the user
- Now this library has a Rust crate.
  - Check it at <https://crates.io/crates/mapfile_parser>

### Changed

- Speed-up the actual parsing of a mapfile by using the native Rust implementation
  - Up to 10 times faster parsing has been registered
- Change build system from `hatchling` to `maturin`

## [2.1.5] - 2023-10-02

### Added

- Add `CHANGELOG.md`
- Add markdown linter to CI

### Changed

- Cleanup the `README.md` a bit
- Update Github Action's dependencies

### Deprecated

- Deprecate `File.getName`
  - The method itself doesn't make sense, instead operate on `File.filepath` directly
- Deprecate `MapFile.debugging`
- Deprecate `progress` frontend's `--debugging` flag

## [2.1.4] - 2023-09-11

### Fixed

- Fix vrom calculation if the first symbol of a file is not available in the
  map file

## [1.3.2] - 2023-09-11

- Output `none` instead of `"None"` for symbols with no vrom when generating
  json output.

### Fixed

- Fix vrom calculation if the first symbol of a file is not available in the
  map file

## [2.1.3] - 2023-08-30

### Fixed

- Fix version number
  - pypi thought previous version was a prerelease instead of a full release

## [2.1.2] - 2023-08-30

### Added

  - Numbers are outputted as real numbers instead of prettified strings
- Add some CI tests

### Changed

- Don't drop the dummy segment if it actually has data on it

## [2.1.1] - 2023-08-15

### Fixed

- Fix off-by-one issue which was throwing away tons of data

## [2.1.0] - 2023-08-14

### Added

- Add `bss_check` frontend
  - Allows to search for reordered bss variables by comparing two map files.

### Changed

- Don't skip important lines in some kinds of map files.
  - This may produce map parsing to be a bit slower but it should work properly
    with more kinds of mapfiles

### Fixed

- Try to prevent crashes if a file is found before the first segment is found

## [2.0.1] - 2023-08-07

### Changed

- Makes `Symbol`, `File` and `Segment` hashable

## [1.3.1] - 2023-08-06

### Changed

### Added

- `toJson` method which allow serializing map files into the json format.
- `jsonify` frontend which allows converting a mapfile into a json format from
  the CLI.

### Changed

- Change logic of `MapFile` so it can parse and organize each file in proper
  segments.
  - This breaks old ways of iterating the `MapFile` class. Now iterating it
    yields a `Segment`, iterating that yields a `File`.
- Rename `segmentType` to `sectionType` and `filterBySegmentType` to
  `filterBySectionType`.

## [1.3.0] - 2023-08-01

### Added

- Add function `toJson` to export map file as a json. It returns a `dict`.

  - Allow an optional bytes converter callback. It can be useful to perform
    analysis or instruction decoding on the caller side.
  - Parameter to toggle colons (`:`) in bytes difference output

## [1.1.5] - 2023-07-28

### Fixed

- Fix map parsing ignoring some `*fill*` entries
